# My Actionplan FRONTEND

This is a web application where users can create their own action plan and add necessary steps to complete the task. It is designed for individual use only, so users can't see other users' action plans. Users can create, read, update, and delete their own profiles, action plans, and steps.

## Build with

React, Javascript, React Bootstrap, HTML, CSS

## Build by

This app is build by [Sotiris Ntokas](https://github.com/SotDok) [Pim Blom](https://github.com/8lom). The app is made for project 3 on the Ironhack Bootcamp Web Development.


## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies required to run the project.

You will also need to install `axios` and `react-bootstrap` for this project. Run the following commands in your terminal to install them:

```sh
npm install axios
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

## Running the app

To run in your computer, follow these steps:

```sh
npm run start
```

This will start the app on your local machine and you can access it through your web browser.

## Milestones

Our project involved several milestones, which are listed below:

1. Creating models: We started by creating the database models required for the app.
2. Creating API routes: Next, we created the backend API routes required to handle user authentication and action plan creation, update, and deletion.
3. Building components and pages: Once the backend was set up, we moved on to building the frontend components and pages for the app.
4. Styling with React Bootstrap: Finally, we used React Bootstrap to style the app and make it look more visually appealing.

## Getting started

To start using My Actionplan, go to https://my-actionplan.netlify.app/ and sign up for an account. If you already have an account, simply log in with your name, email and password.


## Functionality

My Actionplan app is a simple yet powerful tool to help users organize their tasks and accomplish their goals. The app has the following features:

### User Authentication

To use the app, users must create an account and log in. This ensures that only authorized users can access and modify their own action plans and steps.

### Action Plan Creation

Once logged in, users can create a new action plan. They can give it a name, add a description, and set a due date. This will create a new action plan in the user's profile.

### Step Creation

Next, users can add steps to their action plan. They can give each step a name, add a description, and mark it as completed or not completed. This allows users to break down their action plan into smaller, more manageable tasks.

### Action Plan Editing

Users can edit their action plan at any time. They can change the name, description, and due date. They can also delete the action plan entirely if they no longer need it.

### Step Editing

Similarly, users can edit their steps at any time. They can change the name, description, and completion status. They can also delete a step entirely if they no longer need it.

### Profile Editing

Users can edit their profile information, such as their name, email address, age and city. This allows them to keep their account up to date and secure.

### Data Persistence

All user data is stored in a database, ensuring that their action plans and steps are saved even if they log out or close the app. This means they can pick up where they left off at any time.

### Frontend Interface

The frontend of the app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library. The app is designed to be simple and intuitive, with clear labels and buttons that guide users through the process of creating and managing their action plans.

### Responsive Design

The app is built with a responsive design, which means it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Users can access the app from their desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone and still enjoy a seamless experience.

That's a detailed version of the functionality of the My actionplan app. With these features, users can create a comprehensive action plan, break it down into smaller steps, and track their progress towards their goal.

That's it! With this README file, users should be able to easily install and run the My Actionplan app on their local machine.
